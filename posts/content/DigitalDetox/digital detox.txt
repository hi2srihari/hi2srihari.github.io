Just the other night , I went on a massive unsubscribe , unfollow , unlike spree on twitter, instagram, reddit and Facebook.

Faced with a deluge of meaningless notifications and unwanted posts from people whom I had followed a while back, but whom I no longer find to be relevant 
to my world view and growth.

It felt tiring at times, but was finally rewarding.


In this day and age , our word views , our orientation , political opinions and so much more are shaped by whom we follow on social media.

And most social media algorithms are faithful feedback loops , showing us more and more of what we already paid attention to , and makes very little effort to radically alter or expand our views with contradictory or complementing content.

I don't blame silicon valley for it.

The responsibility of being willing enough to have a balanced outlook on life , the universe and other things rests squarely on the shoulders of us consumers.

And how much mental "room" we have for ideas and opinions is in fact finite (although it can be increased by activities such as mindfulness meditation)

so in order to be able to embrace and assimilate anything new , one has to be willing to let go of the old.

For it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

Here's hoping that we all be responsible netizens and hold our guard against espousing constipated worldviews
