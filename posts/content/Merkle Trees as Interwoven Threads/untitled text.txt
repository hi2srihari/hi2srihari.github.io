Merkle Tree is a data structure used in Blockchains like Bitcoin.

Merkle Tree Root is computed by repeated hashing of the leaf nodes of a Merkle Tree two at a time.

Much like two threads being woven together to create a stronger resultant thread, when two T hashes are hashed together,
the resultant hash becomes an order of magnitude more difficult to reverse engineer.

And then the result "twice as strong as the previous" thread is further woven with an equally strong "twice as strong" thread"
making the resultant thread "four times as strong as the previous", this process is repeat until we get a single,
"super strong" thread that is virtually impossible to break.
